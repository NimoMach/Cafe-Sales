## Project Brief Description
- I have used Microsoft Excel for understanding and cleaning of data
- Found key metrics like, orders per day, quantity sold, total revenue generated, peak sales time and many more.
- I used a table to represent product wise profits from every store location, this table can be used as filter in the dashboard to get values for a product from a store loaction.
- Used another filter option on store location to get values related to that store location.
